üõ†Ô∏è **Redis RAG Workbench** is a development playground for exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with Redis. Upload a PDF and begin building a RAG app to chat with the document, taking full advantage of Redis features like **vector search**, **semantic caching**, **LLM memory**, and **semantic routing**.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have the following tools available:
   - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Python >= 3.11 and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
   - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - [Cohere API key](https://cohere.com/) (for optional reranking features)


2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-rag-workbench.git
   cd redis-rag-workbench
   ```


3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
   ```


## Start the workbench
In the root of the repository, run the following to spin up the docker compose stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
   ```

> This will start the server, and you can access the workbench by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

> The first time the application runs, it will have to download model weights from huggingface and may take a few minutes.
